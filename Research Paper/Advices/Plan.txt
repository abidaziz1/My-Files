Quick Start Path for YOU:
Given your CEH background + interest in security + AI/ML:
Week 1-2: Get Familiar
Read paper #5 (One-day vulnerabilities)
Install DeepTeam (#26) - easiest to start
Try jailbreaking a safe test LLM
Week 3-4: Hands-On
Set up PentestGPT or HackGPT
Try using ChatGPT for basic pentesting tasks
Document what works, what doesn't
Month 2: Research Direction
Pick ONE path:
Path A: Multi-agent hacking systems (like #6)
Path B: LLM for vulnerability detection (like #20)
Path C: Novel jailbreaking techniques (like #2)
Month 3: Your Contribution
Identify a gap (I listed many in the artifact)
Design your approach
Start experiments
Specific Project Ideas:
Project 1: "Budget Agent"
Can smaller models (Llama-3, Mistral) exploit simple vulnerabilities?
Paper #5 shows they can't, but maybe with better prompting?
Project 2: "Domain Specialist"
LLM agent specifically for one vulnerability class (e.g., SQLi)
Could outperform generalist agents
Project 3: "Defense Evaluation"
Test existing defenses against LLM-generated attacks
Most papers focus on attacks, few on defenses
Project 4: "IoT Red Teaming"
Apply LLM agents to IoT firmware testing
Underexplored area

Start with these 5 papers:
#4 (NIDS systematic study) - Most recent, good experimental methodology
#12 (Malware detection at CCS 2024) - Top conference, practical approach
#1 (Survey paper) - Understand the full landscape
#6 (Modeling realistic attacks) - Teaches you threat modeling
#31 (GitHub repo) - Browse latest top-tier papers
Then pick ONE of these paths:
Path A - NIDS Focus:
Read papers #4-11
Replicate one attack from #4 on NSL-KDD dataset
Identify a gap (e.g., "What about attacks on transformer-based NIDS?")
Path B - Malware Focus:
Read papers #12-17
Get the VirusShare dataset
Try implementing adversarial training defense
Path C - Biometrics:
Read papers #22-25
Focus on face recognition systems
Explore liveness detection vulnerabilities
Next Concrete Steps (Week-by-Week):
Week 1: Read survey paper #1 + one domain paper
Week 2: Set up environment (Python, PyTorch, relevant libraries)
Week 3: Download a dataset and replicate basic attacks (FGSM)
Week 4: Document what worked, what didn't, identify gaps
